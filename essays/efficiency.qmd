As we’ve said in the class efficiency is a pivotal component of statistical computing (and data science). In this essay, give an explanation of what that term “efficiency” means in relation to statistical computing and describe some places where you encountered efficiency and understood its importance. Your essay should address the following questions:

What is the definition of “efficiency”?

What does efficiency look like in statistical computing / data science?

What does efficiency allow you to do?

Why is efficiency important?

Where did you encounter efficiency, and what were some “a-ha” moments you had about efficiency? (For the latter, tie each a-ha moment to an artifact in the portfolio.)

Efficiency in statistical computing and data science refers to the ability to perform tasks with minimal computational resources, time, and redundancy, while maintaining clarity and accuracy. In practice, efficiency involves writing concise, reusable, and scalable code that optimally leverages tools and techniques to solve problems. It allows data scientists to handle large datasets, execute complex analyses, and iterate quickly, ultimately enabling a more productive and focused workflow. Efficiency is important because it not only saves time but also reduces the risk of errors, simplifies debugging, and makes code easier to maintain and share with others. To me, its being able to see inefficiencies and combining them into more efficient calls. I think it pushes us to come up with the most optimal and creative solutions which is why its so important. 

Throughout my labs, I encountered efficiency in several key areas. One “a-ha” moment came in Lab 7, where I used the across() function to summarize missing values across all variables in a single concise pipeline, avoiding repetitive code for each column. Another instance was in Lab 9, where the use of map() functions allowed me to simulate data iteratively without manually writing loops, significantly simplifying my workflow. And finally lab 5 was obviously the most fun becaue there was so many different ways of finding the murder suspect suing joins, filters etc. transformations, making complex operations both readable and efficient. These experiences underscored the importance of understanding not just what functions to use, but how and why they work, fostering a deeper appreciation for efficient practices in data science.
